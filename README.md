#选高立新(Lixin Gao, UMass Amherst)做导师太坑了

Lixin Gao 是马萨诸塞大学阿默斯特分校电气与计算机工程专业的教授。 我为她的学生感到难过。 听同学说她这几年招的博士都跑了。好像五年招了五个，跑了三个😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂。貌似她经常嘲讽她的学生。 几乎所有学生的工资都会被她扣，她还会拖着不让毕业。听说她的学生生不如死，一直不能毕业。如果是这样，永远不要和这种导师读博士。

PhD working with Lixin Gao(UMass Amherst) is miserable

Lixin Gao is a prof in the ECE of University of Massachusetts Amherst. I feel so sorry for her students.

Nearly all the doctoral students she recruited in recent years have run away. Almost five of them have been recruited in five years and three have run away😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. It seems that she often taunts her students. And almost all students will have their wages deducted by her. It is said that her students would rather die than live, and have not been able to graduate. If it is like this, Never read a Ph.D. with this kind of advisor.
